Introduction:
- The main questionnaire page shows two questions, each with image select choices. An additional question has been added to define and display the continuation processes in more detail. The setup uses radio buttons for simplicity.

Files:
- 'PSD' folder shows the support Photoshop (PSD) images
- Layout grabbed from Bootstrap for speed. Some unnecessary code has been removed.
- 'images' folder contains all customised artwork.
- questionnaire.min.css/questionnaire.scss file shows all custom styles directly related to the questionnaire and text file.
- I've added some comments in the html source code in both files.

Layout:
- Abstract scientific background (British Museum roof) with a structural and connectivity type feel.
- The background has been chosen as it fit a flexible field, without any focal points that would get lost hidden behind the question blocks.
- Question types are irrelevant but show interesting  pictorial representation as apposed to plain text.
- Colours are consistent with brand style.
- Although the psychometrics font styles should have been shown here to be on brand, I have decided to show non-standard and imported font styles which are also clear and accessible. All type is clear, large and colours stand out from the backgrounds - An accessibility decision.
- The reduced responsive layout (under 768px) displays slightly reduced images and h1 font.
- The overlapping images on smaller 320px displays is intentional as I like the transparent over - Something for discussion.
- In all cases, the buttons are large enough to function well on smaller touch screen devices.
- Images retain and display differently in the 'checked' state.
- The button image labels contain aria-label comments for accessibility.
- A single submit could be added at the end of the questionnaire to post all data.
- The additional text_sample.html file has some regular sample styles. The main point here is restricted width for wide screens so lines don't overrun comfortable reading line lengths (max 12-15 words per line). Paragraph style is large enough for small screens and has comfortable leading. Accessible and common fonts used for style sheet alternatives.

Testing:
- Testing done locally across several Browsers (IE, Firefox & Chrome) and devices including tablet and mobile.

To Run The Files:
- Open the psychometrics_sample1.html file in your browser.
- Touch, mouse-over or click on the images, then select the 'NEXT/SKIP' button to view the next question.
- Progress indicator is set to 25% for each question so loop through the questions twice to fill the indicator.
- Refresh or clear your cache to view the process again.
- Open the text_sample.html to view the text sample file.

Software:
- Atom, SCSS
- I have not used Github much recently due to circumstance and nature of some of my clients but feel confident in progressing in this area.

Summary:
- An enjoyable task which has included some interesting elements, and I've learnt a few new things which is a bonus. Hope you enjoy. Thanks.
